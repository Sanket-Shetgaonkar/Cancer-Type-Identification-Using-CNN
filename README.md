# Cancer-Type-Identification-Using-CNN

This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to identify the type of cancer from histopathological images. The model is trained on a dataset with 5 types of cancers and later reused to identify cancer types in another dataset with 9 categories. The primary goal is to assist medical practitioners in accurately diagnosing cancer, thereby aiding in better treatment and cure.
